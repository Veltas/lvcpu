This file contains information about the architecture of the CPU I virtualize.

The CPU has two main registers: A and C, both 16-bit.
AL, AH, CL and CH refer to low and high bytes of the registers.
There is a flags register F, 8-bit, some bits have special meanings.
There is a stack pointer register SP, 16-bit.
There is a stack base pointer register BP, 16-bit.
There is an instruction pointer IP, 16-bit.
There is an instruction counter IC, 8-bit.
There is an interrupt register T, 8-bit.

Not listed, the CPU remembers if interrupts are currently enabled or
disabled, if the counter interrupt is enabled or disabled, if the
instruction step interrupt is enabled or disabled, if an interrupt
is currently being handled.

All the listed registers have shadow registers, which can be swapped
with in an instruction. Interrupts typically use these shadow
registers to maintain a copy of state, so without disabling
interrupts their state is volatile. Shadow registers are referred to
with a tick, e.g. A', although shadow registers do not appear in
assembly code.

All registers are zero on boot.

Every time IC increments and becomes 0, the counter zero
interrupt is triggered if enabled.

Every instruction processed outside of handling interrupts will
trigger the step interrupt if enabled (unless a counter interrupt is
happening).

Interrupt codes are 7-bit. The interrupt handlers occupy 16 bytes each. The
address called for an interrupt code is 16*CODE+2048*T. Note that only the low
5 bits of T are relevant.

If an error interrupt is thrown while an interrupt is being handled, a double
fault is thrown instead.

Interrupts:
0x00 Invalid instruction error
0x01 Instruction counter zero
0x02 Memory error
0x03 Double fault error
0x04 Step
0x05-0x0F reserved
0x10-0x3F hardware reserved
0x40-0x7F software defined

On interrupt:
  If in interrupt mode
    Set A' to return address
    If CODE is error and handling an interrupt already
      Jump to 16*3+2048*T
    else
      Jump to 16*CODE+2048*T
  DONE
