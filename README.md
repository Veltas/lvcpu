lvcpu
=====

Description of the architecture is in `cpu/arch.txt`.

Emulator in `cpu/`.

Assembler is `asm/asm.lua`.

OS will go in `vos`.

This code is in early stages, the scripts are quite ugly, was mainly just trying to get stuff working.
Ideally emulator would be written in C or C++, and the assembler could be written better.
